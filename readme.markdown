Code used in my lucene.net presentation
========

The sample texts were taken from a wikipedia xml dump file using the python program at `scripts\extract.py`

If you wish to run the demo code, you need to have .txt files in a directory defined in the `source\Common\Configuration.cs`.

You may either download a wikipedia dump and extract the files using the script or unzip the 1000 files contained in the '`files.7z`' file.
 
You can find the presentation [here][1]

Lucene was compiled from the 2.4.0 tag [here][2]
